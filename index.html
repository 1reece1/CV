<h2>Working History</h2>
<p>During my time at FMS Contractors, I leant many new skills as an apprentice plumber. It was part an NVQ level 3<br />
     PLumbing and heating course under West Kent College. I worked on many new builds, learning how to work around<br />
      a close knit team for much larger firms. It taught me how to work under leadership and work off of a plan,<br />
    which has helped me greatly in my years working in other industries. I then moved to Tesco Plc as a seasonal colleague,<br />
I worked in this position for most of the christmas months of 2021 on the tills. This helped me learn customer service <br />skills 
and interpersonal skills used in the workplace and quickly surpassed my immediate colleagues.</p>
<p>After that, I progressed into a Customer service advisor position at Freedom Leisure Crowborough. This helped me learn how companies work and how to work best as a team.<br />
 I worked everyday here meeting and admitting thousands of people into the building forming lasting relationships with customers and colleagues alike.
After six months, I decided to take a career change inside the company and become a lifeguard. During my time as a lifeguard I grew as an asset to the 
company in aiding customer service. During my time as a lifeguard I brough on many changes to my job role and how it is learnt in my centre.
 Again after six months, I progressed into a management position at Freedom Leisure Uckfield (The neighboring site). This brought many challanges that grew
 me as an employee and person. I learned on a greater level how to manage people and how to make money for a business when managing my areas of responsibility.
